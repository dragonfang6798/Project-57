                   <h1> My favorite hobby: Playing video games </h1>
  <p>
   I like playing video games because they are fun and if
you are bored or sad, it cheers you up and you can have fun! I also think video games are cool because some games allow you to be creative, like Minecraft or Roblox, they can make you think hard like Tetris or Candy Crush, or they can make you be ready for anything, like Fortnite.</p> </section>
